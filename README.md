# NY_Citibike_with_Tableau
Creating spreadsheets, dashboards, and stories based on data from the New York City bike sharing program.

## Overview
I came up with the concept to see Des Moines similarly after taking a bike tour of New York City and touring the city on two wheels. The information we have can be utilized to forecast whether Des Moines' proposed bike-share program would be successful. Additionally, Kate met a potential investor who was enthusiastic about investing. It was necessary to persuade investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a sound business idea. A bike ride analysis that one of our major stakeholders required helped to support our proposition.
